Here are the implementations for each of the functions (swap, findMax, and reverseArray) along with their respective time and space complexities.

1. Swap Function:
This function swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

c
Copy code
// Function to swap two integers using pointers
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;  // Store the value of *a in a temporary variable
    *a = *b;        // Assign the value of *b to *a
    *b = temp;      // Assign the value of temp (which was *a) to *b
}
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(1) because we are performing a constant number of operations (assignments) regardless of input size.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because the only extra space used is for a temporary variable temp, which does not depend on the size of the input.

2. FindMax Function:
This function finds the maximum value in an array using pointers.

c
Copy code
// Function to find the maximum value in an array using pointers
int findMax(int *arr, int length) {
    int max = arr[0];  // Initialize max as the first element of the array
    for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {  // Iterate through the rest of the array
        if (*(arr + i) > max) {  // Use pointer arithmetic to access array elements
            max = *(arr + i);  // Update max if a larger value is found
        }
    }
    return max;  // Return the maximum value found
}
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. We must traverse through the entire array once to find the maximum value.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1), as only a few integer variables (max and the loop counter) are used, regardless of the size of the array.

3. ReverseArray Function:
This function reverses an array using pointers.

c
Copy code
// Function to reverse an array using pointers
void reverseArray(int *arr, int length) {
    int start = 0, end = length - 1;  // Initialize pointers for the start and end
    while (start < end) {  // Continue swapping until the pointers meet
        int temp = *(arr + start);  // Use pointer arithmetic to access elements
        *(arr + start) = *(arr + end);  // Swap the elements at start and end
        *(arr + end) = temp;  // Complete the swap
        start++;  // Move the start pointer forward
        end--;    // Move the end pointer backward
    }
}
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The loop runs through half of the array, performing constant-time operations per iteration.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because only a few integer variables (start, end, and temp) are used, regardless of the size of the array.

Summary of Time and Space Complexities
Function	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
swap()	O(1)	O(1)
findMax()	O(n)	O(1)
reverseArray()	O(n)	O(1)
swap(): Constant time and space because it just swaps two elements.
findMax(): Linear time as it needs to iterate through the array once; constant space.
reverseArray(): Linear time to reverse the array; constant space as it modifies the array in-place.
